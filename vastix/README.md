# Vastix - TUI for go-vast-client

Vastix is a Terminal User Interface (TUI) application that provides an interactive interface for using [go-vast-client](https://github.com/vast-data/go-vast-client). It offers a k9s-style interface for managing and testing VAST Data resources.

## ⚠️ Beta Status

**This tool is currently in beta and should NOT be considered an official VAST client.** The primary purpose of Vastix is for testing and development. This may change in the future as the tool matures.

## Background

The go-vast-client library includes autogenerated code that generates resources from the VAST API's Swagger schema. Due to the extensive size of the VAST API (with hundreds of resources and operations), manually testing every endpoint and resource type became impractical. 

Vastix was created to address this challenge by providing an easy-to-use TUI for interactive testing and exploration of go-vast-client resources. This approach enables rapid testing, debugging, and validation of the autogenerated code without writing individual test scripts for each resource.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.19 or higher
- Access to a VAST Data cluster

### Building the Application

To build the vastix binary:

```bash
make build
```

This will create the executable at `bin/vastix`.

### Running the Application

To build and run vastix:

```bash
make run
```

For debug mode with verbose logging:

```bash
make run-debug
```

### Installing the Application

To install vastix system-wide as the `vx` command:

```bash
make install
```

This installs the binary to `/usr/local/bin/vx` (requires sudo). After installation, you can run:

```bash
vx
```

To uninstall:

```bash
make uninstall
```
